# Introduction:
This repository serves as creative website to demonstrate my skills in frontend web development.
CodeJoy Creations is a fictional web platform created to showcase a diverse set of skills tailored for the attention of recruiters at Forge The Code.

# About Me:

I'm Alicia Pak, an aspiring web developer dedicated to continuous learning and growth.
Myy goal is to contribute my expertise to the dynamic tech industry and make a positive impact.

I have developed CodeJoy Creations with React.js + Vite and TawilwindCSS.
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
